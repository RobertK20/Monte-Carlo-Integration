Python library with Monte Carlo integration function.

Scaled to support x dimensions

To use, call mcintegrate.integrate(f,n,lims), where f is a function of x arguments, n is the number of iterations and lims are the limits of the integral (functions or numbers).

Some commonly used limits have been cached already.
