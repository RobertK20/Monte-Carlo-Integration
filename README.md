Python library with Monte Carlo integration function.

Scaled to support x dimensions

To use, call MonteCarloIntegrate.integrate(f,n,lims), where f is a function of x arguments, n is the number of iterations and lims are the limits of the integral (functions or numbers).

QuadratureIntegrate.py contains a simple one-dimensional quadrature integration function, which can be used to compare with the results of the Monte Carlo function.
